# Calculator
Hi:wave: I am learning Android development. This is my Android 101 attempt to make a calculator app. Nothing to fancy, but if your calculator ever broke on you, you know what to do :wink:

## Dependencies
I am developing this on Kotlin `1.3.72` and using Gradle to build. `Android 21` is the earliest version of Android SDK supported.

## Installation
Clone the repo into a folder, make sure you have the required dependencies, and build the project with Gradle. You can install the app on your physical device or an emulator.
